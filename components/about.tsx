            I'm a passionate Computer Science student at Vellore Institute of Technology with a strong foundation in
            full-stack development. With experience in modern web technologies like React, Next.js, and Node.js, I enjoy
            creating innovative solutions to complex problems.

            My journey in tech has been marked by hands-on experience through internships, personal projects, and active
            participation in tech communities like ACM VIT. I've worked on everything from real-time applications to
            mobile apps, always focusing on user experience and clean code.

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or
            organizing tech events. I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to take on new challenges.
